# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

Continue with existing Next.js monorepo structure while improving organization.

## Service Architecture

Maintain monolithic Next.js architecture while introducing better separation of concerns through:

- Service layer pattern implementation
- Repository pattern for data access
- Clear API layer abstraction

## Testing Requirements

Implement comprehensive testing strategy:

- Unit tests for all business logic (>80% coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for React components
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- Use existing tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, MySQL, etc.)
- Maintain Docker containerization
- Preserve MCP server functionality
- Keep existing external API integrations
- Maintain current deployment strategy
