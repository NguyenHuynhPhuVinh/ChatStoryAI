# Infrastructure and Deployment

## Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** Docker Compose 3.8
- **Location:** `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`
- **Approach:** Container-based deployment với service orchestration

## Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Container-based deployment với Docker
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Environments

- **Development:** Local development với Docker Compose
- **Staging:** Container deployment trên cloud platform
- **Production:** Scalable container deployment với load balancing

## Environment Promotion Flow

```
Development (Local Docker) → Staging (Cloud Container) → Production (Scaled Deployment)
```

## Rollback Strategy

- **Primary Method:** Container image rollback với previous stable version
- **Trigger Conditions:** Health check failures, error rate thresholds
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 5 minutes cho critical issues
